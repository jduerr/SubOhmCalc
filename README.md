SubOhmCalc
==========

Little Calculator i use to quick check what load, power and voltage is going to be drained out of the battery if using a mechanical mod. I always find myself calculating in my head while wicking Thema dripping atomizer. - Thaught - lets just wick, measure Ohm - and do the calculation within a small app. That's when the idea for subOhmCalc was born. --> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!
