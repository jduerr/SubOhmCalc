SubOhmCalc
==========

Little Calculator i use to quick check what load, power an voltage is going to be drained out of the battery with an mechanical mod. I always find myself calculating that in my head while whicking my dripping atomizer. - Thaught - lets just whick, measure Ohm - and do the calculation within a small app. --> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!
